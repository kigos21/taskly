# About this project
This is the first project that I was able to apply all my learnings across HTML, CSS, PHP, and some JavaScript.
I learned about simple database interactions. I also learned user-handling and verification. PHP was a great 
language to work with due to its simplicity. However, as the codebase scales, I find it hard to refactor and make things
modular.

I used centralized navbars, and side panel using `include()`. Played around the FullCalendar library and was able to render
to-do tasks on the calendar using a "feed" of PHP objects parsed as JSON.

Had fun!
